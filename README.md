#### **Project 2:** Housing Prices Prediction Project.


**Project idea** – The dataset has house prices of the Boston residual areas.

The expense of the house varies according to various factors like crime rate, number of rooms, etc.

It is a good ML project for beginners to predict prices on the basis of new data.
